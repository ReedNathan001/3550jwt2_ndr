# 3550jwt2_ndr
add keys to database while maintaining valid jwt

This project is about creating a server with minimal security, so do not use for production.
As before, there is RSA key generation, two handlers for the web server, with a RESTful JWKS endpoint.
If issues persist, at least when running on macOS, uninstall jwt and then install pyJWT to restore funtionality.
Instructions to run the gradebot and testsuite are commented at top of code.
